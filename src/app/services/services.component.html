            <h3>Crispy Chicken</h3>
            <p>I experimented with lots of recipes over the years to find the best crispy fried chicken. This is it! It's bits and pieces of hints I have heard over the years. It's more a matter of preparation and cooking method! Paprika adds smoky flavor and has a low smoke point, which helps with browning the chicken.</p>

            <h3>Fried Chicken</h3>
            <p>A wonderful recipe for deep-fried chicken with a Southern taste all its own. The hint of tangy buttermilk under a crispy coating of deliciousness makes this chicken stand out. Seasoning blend can be altered to your taste; some may find it too salty.</p>
